# DroughtAndBirthOutcomes

This repository contains the codes and the publicly available datasets used to prepare the analysis for a empirical research paper that investigates the effets of a drought on birth weights. 

<ins>The datasets include:</ins>
1. Child level data from the [Philippines National Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) 2017](https://dhsprogram.com/publications/publication-fr347-dhs-final-reports.cfm). This data can be requested from the [DHS Program](https://dhsprogram.com/).

<ins>The codes include:</ins>
1. Spatial interpolation code file - this prepares the raster maps for the Philippines and interpolates the drought index called the Strandardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index [(SPEI)](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/standardized-precipitation-evapotranspiration-index-spei) for the cluster-level geographic coordinates in the Philippines NDHS 2017.

2. Data cleaning and preparation - trimming the dataset to include only relevant samples and columns, generating variables 

3. Preparing summary statistics (upcoming)

4. Runnning regressions (upcoming)
